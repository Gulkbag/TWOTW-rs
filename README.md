# Why rust?

Rust is a systems programming language targeting roughly the same space as C++. That means it’s fast and is generally used for things where you need a fair bit of control over how are things structured in memory, etc. Rust is a good candidate for writing a browser, database, operating system, web server and…​ games.

What made me like Rust is that it's pretty low level so i could use it for stuff i would normally go for C for, with good support for calling into libs writtein C/C++, it's a language that lets you write clean code but in the same time use low level stuff (C is still the best tho lmao its' my favorite language).

# Libraries

Why libtcod? it's a library that's simple and specially written for rougelikes, it gives me everything i need to make a rougelike

`NOTE: libtcod originally was a C++ library and has a python version, but i am using for this the rust binding tcod-rs`

`NOTE: please don't use the code for this game as a refrence, it can be improved by a ton and made with more care and more better coding practices`
