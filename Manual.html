	<h2>Gameplay: </h2>
	<p1>You are dropped into a randomly generated dungeon (like most rougelikes) and left to fight, niggers, jews, minorities and whatever else, items are picked up into the inventory and can be used, there's consumable items, usable items, and equippable items, damaging enemies is as easy as walking into them, equippable items add stats to the player like attack power, defnese, etc</p1>
